page layouts are in general just a logical storage for coordinates of what a page should look like statically;
where icons are - what config; rows, clumps, etc - and the positioning of those rows, etc
layouts themselves aren't supposed to be in the painting-space of things; they have a paint() currently, 
but it should be used just to paint the initial layout or reset the layout to initial state

IconCell will have a pointer to an icon (IconBase) so that it can affect its position in paint-space
IconBase will not have a ptr back to IconCell. 

Painter functions  (particularly in non QGraphicsItem objects)

paintAuto() is to be called during the regular scene self-painting chain
paintOffscreen() is intended to paint to pixmaps

--------------------------
absolute dimensions vs relative (%'age of max) dimensions
--------------------------
easier code-wise to have actual variables in the "settings" classes to have absolute positions, and then
to have some higher level class apply %'age calculations (if desired); can possibly have multiple Settings objects
pre-created based on fixed UI sizes and %'ages and then just swap the ones returned from calls to settings::instance()-like 
functions
